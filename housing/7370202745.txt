2 bedroom house with over-sized kitchen, laundry room. The bathroom has an oversized shower. There are beautiful vistas of redwood hills and sunset.  House has large wrap-around deck.
Garbage, water and septic included.  Internet available via satellite service. House has one shared wall with a studio apartment. The neighbor is a very quiet tenant of over 10 years. The studio entrance is on the opposite side of the property so the house is very private.
The property is located 4 1/2 miles above Soquel in a gated community. Great central Santa Cruz County location and commutable to Silicon Valley. 
No pets, no smoking -- no exceptions.
