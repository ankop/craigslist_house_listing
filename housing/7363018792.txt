Beautiful, sunlit apartment with high ceilings, arches and hardwood floors.  Completely remodeled and updated in 2011.  Well cared for and freshly painted.  Lots of windows and natural light.  Open kitchen with plenty of counter space, cabinet storage, dishwasher and garbage disposal.  Two bedrooms with a closet in each.  One bathroom with claw-foot tub and shower.  Washer and drier in the building.  
Front- and back-yard gardens, with BBQ area and porch.   If you are looking for a small yard to putter around in, this could be a heavenly spot for you.  
Walking distance to downtown Point Richmond (and the beach) in a lovely, friendly neighborhood.  This place is few miles from the new Richmond-to-San Francisco ferry and access to 80 is easy!  Point Richmond is a sweet town with several restaurants, a pub, and several art galleries and shops.  
This unit is the upstairs unit in a duplex and we are looking for a good addition to our happy, no-drama community.  Come have a look... This place is nicer than the average rental property.  Landlord is local and attentive.  Please contact us to see the property!
