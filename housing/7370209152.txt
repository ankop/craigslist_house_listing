San Francisco's Marina District is one of the cleanest, safest, most friendly neighborhoods in the City.  The beautiful Palace of Fine Arts is the last remaining building from the 1915 Panama Pacific Exposition, showing the world how San Francisco has bounced back from the devastating 1906 earthquake and fire,  and it's only a block away from the building.  Also a close by is the SF Yacht Harbor, home to the St. Francis Yacht Club and Golden Gate Yacht Club, Chrissy Field, the Marina Green, the Presidio GGNRA, Safeway, and vehicle entrance to the Golden Gate Bridge.  A short walk will bring you to the fabulous dining and shopping of Chestnut and Union Streets.  It's a great bicycling area with trails across to Marin or through the City.
