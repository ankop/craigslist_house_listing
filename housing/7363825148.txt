Hello Everyone,
***Available Now**

Just one person per room please. 2500 per month for the entire apt in law with all utilities covered. Internet is included as well
Please email me SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF if you are interested. Thank you
Here is the description of the layout of the house.
Private Entry leading into this great in law apt is:
A nicely built 2 bedrooms 1 full baths in-law apartment for rent in the Outer Sunset Parkside District of San Francisco. My apt in law has hardwood floors throughout and the two bedrooms are very decent size. There is a full bath and a nice kitchen for you as well. Public Transportation includes L Taraval Muni which is (one block away) and the 71, 18, and 29 bus lines are also all walking distant from our house. It's very easy and convenient to get to Downtown ( Fidi ), City College, and SF State University (SFSU). We are two blocks from the ocean with trails and pathways. This apt is perfect for two students or two young professionals. The top unit is occupied by my family. We are very respectful and quiet so we're looking for tenants that will do the same. Ideally, we'd like to rent to someone who is clean, drama free, and will pay rent on time. The place is available now.

Monthly Rent: $1250 per room with all utilities included with a negotiable lease terms (six months or 1 year with option to extend month to month). Internet will be included as well. 
Security Deposit: $1,500 per person.
