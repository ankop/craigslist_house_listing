William Patrick Dougherty was known as "The Lumber King of Santa Clara Valley." He built a beautiful mansion at 460 North First Street around 1893. His family lived in the Hotel Von Domme across the street. His wife, Anna Fenton Dougherty moved into the house with her two children and ran his many companies after his death. Mr. Dougherty owned most of the San Lorenzo canyon in Santa Cruz County, the Dougherty Lumber Company, and founded the Santa Clara Valley Mill & Lumber Company. The home was built in the historic Hensley district near the city limits. The original property encompassed the entire block of land on North First Street between Hensley and Empire. It was built as a showcase to display the finest building materials that were available at the time. After Mrs. Dougherty's death in 1931, the mansion was converted into 9 apartments, and two wings consisting of 26 additional apartments were added on with Spanish style architecture to create a beautiful courtyard. What remains is a beautiful blend of Victorian and Spanish architecture
