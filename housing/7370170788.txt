“Famous for being the largest Chinatown outside of Asia, San Francisco’s Chinatown is a vibrant neighborhood teeming with cultural offerings. Nestled between Nob Hill and the Financial District, Chinatown is one of the top destinations in the city for its fantastic sights, shopping, and dining.
Grant Avenue and Stockton Street are the neighborhood’s main thoroughfares, each touting rows of dim sum spots, bakeries, tea houses, cafes, markets, and specialty stores. Some of Chinatown’s most notable landmarks include the Dragon’s Gate, the Chinese Historical Society of America, and Tin How Temple.
Chinatown residents enjoy an array of lively, year-round events, such as the Chinese Culture Center Spring Festival, Autumn Moon Festival, and the popular Chinese New Year Festival and Parade. The neighborhood’s central locale affords residents easy commutes and travels.”
