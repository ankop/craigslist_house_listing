Been living in this 30' 2001 fleetwood wilderness travel trailer for 6 years. It's honestly great, it's just time for a change for me.
The trailer is for sale, if you want to live in it you must purchase it from me. You can then take over the lease for the space at the trailer park and pay monthly rent. 
The price is $6000.  The rent for the park is $850, plus utilities. Water power and sewage, mailbox, garbage pick up are charged, the total varies on energy and water used. Usually comes out to $900-950 in the winter when I run a heater
I put in a new washer dryer, toilet+bidet, fridge, hot water heater, changed light fixtures and added shut off valves to the plumbing lines.
Extensive repairs have been done, including sealing the roof.
There are stairs to get in the trailer. The ceilings are 6'5". The park is located in 94619. Pets are permitted. 
This is a better stationary than travel trailer
Because trailers are built precisely balanced for driving, and I don't know how adding the washer dryer and altering the original furniture has changed this balance, I highly encourage this trailer to be purchased by someone who wants to take over the lease as well as buy the trailer.
I can talk about including the furniture I made as well if you're interested. Some tools that I won't use anymore (plumbing and electrical tools) I can include for you.
The park is chill and the neighborhood is amazing.
Lmk if you're interested, I can get lots more pictures for you.
Registration current.
