Location: Day st at Church. Walking distance to Upper Noe Valley restaurants, Safeway, J-Church muni line and Mitchell Ice Cream! Easy and quick access to 280. Super close to tech shuttles stop.
Sunny condo with lots of natural light. On the back and quiet side of a charming building, with only three units which are all owner occupied. Comes unfurnished. 1000 sq ft with 3 bedrooms and 2 full baths. Two of the bedrooms are quite big size while 3rd bedroom is smaller and ideal as a nursery or office space. The bath off of master bedroom has a shower enclosed in glass door and a sunlight! Bedrooms have top quality built-in wood shelving. Updated kitchen with granite countertops, bar counter area with pendant lighting, built-in wine rack and stainless steel appliances (bottom freezer refrigerator with built in Brita water filter, gas stove top and oven, dishwasher, built-in microwave). Hardwood floors throughout the condo and modern recessed lighting.
Room sizes:
Master bedroom: 13' x 11', also has a bathroom and a huge closet (Available in September)
Second bedroom: 13' x 13.5' (it's the biggest room but doesn't have its own bathroom which is why it is not master bedroom). Has a huge closet
Third bedroom: 9.5' x 9', has a small closet
Lots of street parking available and you don't need a permit! Laundry (washer / dryer) inside the building. Technically for all the building occupants but the other two units have their own washer and dryer inside their condos so this one is used by this apartment!
Rent from the owner who lives in Peninsula. Ideally minimum one-year lease. No smoking inside the condo or building. One month of rent is required as security deposit. Utilities are not included (except water and garbage). Maximum 3 adults.
Prospective tenants will need to provide a reference from a previous landlord, two personal references and a good credit report or proof of ability to pay (last bank statement and 2 recent pay stub). Please email with a description about yourself and the people that will be living in the apartment.
